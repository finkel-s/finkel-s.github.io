Ausgehend von dieser Theorie haben wir eine Reihe von Hypothesen über die Ursachen politischen Protests entwickelt, die bereits in mehreren Untersuchungen überprüft wurden und die sich relativ gut bewährt haben.

Analysis of a survey of 1,800 “treatment” and 1,800 “control” individuals shows that the program had significant long-term effects on variables related to civic competence and engagement, with less consistent effects on democratic values. We also find that participants who subsequently were affected by the violence were less likely to adopt negative beliefs about Kenya’s political system, less likely to support the use of ethnic or political violence, and more likely to forgive those responsible for the post-election violence.\n\nView at Journal Website"

    "text": "Published by British Journal of Political Science.\nAbstract:\n\nWhat are the consequences of being the victim of crime for political participation? Previous studies report mixed results with respect to voter turnout, in contrast to the positive effects found for other indicators of political engagement. However, previous turnout studies have failed to differentiate between violent and non-violent crime, and have relied on cross-sectional survey data that is prone to measurement biases and selection effects. This article addresses these shortcomings via a panel analysis of official registry data from Denmark recording individual-level turnout in two municipal elections (in 2009 and 2013) and victimization from violent and non-violent crime. It identifies the effect of victimization by comparing changes in turnout between the two elections for victims and two different counterfactual groups: non-victims in the general population, and individuals who were victimized after the 2013 election. The results show that victimization from violent crime increases turnout by 2 to 3 percentage points. The study further demonstrates a large negative between-individual effect of victimization, suggesting that previous studies have been marred by severe selection bias.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

Theories of democratic participation argue that positive effects should be seen for at least the first three modes, while little is known about the effects of political violence. Using longitudinal data from the mid-1970s in West Germany, it becomes apparent that these modes of participation have vastly different effects on these political orientations. Voting is found to influence regime support in a positive fashion, while campaign activities influence feelings of political efficacy. Peaceful protest has little effect on either attitude, and aggressive behavior has strong negative effects on regime support. The results are discussed in light of theories of democracy which predict developmental effects of political activity, and in light of previous research which investigates these effects in other countries and in other contexts.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

It finds that the direct effect of socialist values on democratic satisfaction declines substantially from the 1993-96 portion of the panel study to the 1996-98 period. As individuals acquire more experience with the democratic system, they appear to assess the system less in terms of its relation to socialism and the previous regime, and more in terms of current economic and political performance. Moreover, evaluations of the democratic system themselves appear to influence the individuals’ adherence to socialist values throughout the time spanned by the panel studies; in fact, the article shows that there is little direct effect of socialist values on system support by 1998, once the reverse causal process is taken into account. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for democratic development in the former East Germany, and for more general theories and models of the democratization process.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Published by Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology.\nAbstract:\n\nThere is a need for rigorous methods to study the mechanisms that lead to individual-level change (i.e., process-outcome research). We argue that panel data (i.e., longitudinal study of a number of individuals) methods have 3 major advantages for psychotherapy researchers: (1) enabling microanalytic study of psychotherapeutic processes in a clinically intuitive way, (2) modeling lagged associations over time to ensure direction of causality, and (3) isolating within-patient changes over time from between-patient differences, thereby protecting against confounding influences because of the effects of unobserved stable attributes of individuals. However, dynamic panel data methods present a complex set of analytical challenges. We focus on 2 particular issues: (1) how long-term trajectories in the variables of interest over the study period should be handled, and (2) how the use of a lagged dependent variable as a predictor in regression-based dynamic panel models induces endogeneity (i.e., violation of independence between predictor and model error term) that must be taken into account in order to appropriately isolate within- and between-person effects. Method: An example from a study of working alliance in psychotherapy in primary care in Sweden is used to illustrate some of these analytic decisions and their impact on parameter estimates. Results: Estimates were strongly influenced by the way linear trajectories were handled; that is, whether variables were “detrended” or not. Conclusions: The issue of when detrending should be done is discussed, and recommendations for research are provided.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

We use three cross-national longitudinal surveys to address this issue: two collected in Costa Rica in the midst of a severe economic crisis in the late 1970s and early 1980s; and one in West Germany during the recession of the mid-1970s. We show that in both countries, overall support for the political regime remained extremely high during the economic decline, while satisfaction with incumbent performance fluctuated much more sharply. Moreover, at the individual level, changes in satisfaction with incumbent performance were only weakly related to changes in regime support. These results provide strong evidence suggesting that if democracies enter economic downturns with initially high levels of regime support, they will be able to withstand even severe, prolonged crises of economic performance.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

Focusing on the short-term goal of export growth, we examine whether AfT from the US government promoted exports within recipient national economies over the period 1999–2008. Our results suggest that a ( $1 ) dollar increase in total US AfT has been associated with about a ( $69 ) increase in recipient exports 2 years later. We also show that the export effect of US AfT has not been confined to the US market and is driven primarily by exports to the rest of the world. In addition, we show that US AfT has been effective in reaching more needy countries as the substantive effect of US aid for trade has been larger in lesser-developed, landlocked, and more distant recipient countries.\n\nView at Journal Website"

Building on the theoretical and empirical framework established in our previous study and in subsequent work in the field, we estimate: a) the effect of overall USAID Democracy, Human Rights, and Governance (DRG) expenditures on general indices of democracy, b) changes in the effects of DRG expenditures after 2001, and c) the conditions that moderate the impact of DRG funding at the country level in the contemporary era. We find that the effect of DRG expenditures decreased dramatically in the 2002–2014 period, relative to the modest effect shown in the previous study for the period immediately following the end of the Cold War. However, DRG aid remains effective in the current era under favorable conditions. Further analysis demonstrates important conditional effects related to patterns of DRG investment, such that aid has greater impact when levels of security assistance are low (indicating competing priorities) and when prior DRG investment is low (indicating diminishing returns). In addition, DRG is more effective at intermediate levels of democratization and less so in contexts of democratic backsliding.\n\nView at Journal Website"

Published in Cambridge University Press.\nAbstract:\n\nThe chapters in this book are focused on two broad themes. First, should democracy be promoted? Second, how should democracy be promoted? This paper asks and attempts to answer a third question: Does democracy promotion work? In many ways, this is really the prior question, because if democracies cannot be promoted, if their emergence, consolidation and breakdown are entirely random, or follow a pattern that cannot be altered by human intervention, then the prior questions are, after all, moot.\nIn the field of democracy studies, there is perhaps no more controversial and unsettled question than that of how democracies emerge, consolidate and breakdown. The literature is vast, growing in important ways with each passing month. Consider, for example, the role of economic development, just one of the many factors that have been thought to be important for the emergence and/or stability of democracy. The classical literature dates back to Lipset, who found empirical support for the notion that higher levels of economic development were strongly linked to the transition from dictatorship to democracy (Lipset 1959). Over the years some scholars confirmed this finding, whereas others refuted it. By the mid 1990s, however, larger databases with more sophisticated statistical techniques seemed to demonstrate that Lipset was indeed correct (Lewis-Beck and Burkhart 1994; Muller 1997).\n\nView at Journal Website"

Expected utility theories postulate that participation in rebellious action is motivated by expectation of reward and that discontent is relevant at most only insofar as individuals expect that collective action can be successful and that their participation is important to that end. We test these theories with data from a national sample and a sample of students at a protest-prone university in Peru, a country with significant objective conditions of discontent and a high incidence of rebellious political conflict. The results provide no evidence for the discontent models but strong support for the expected utility models. The potential for participation in rebellious political action proves to be a function primarily of discontent weighted by the expectancy of the action’s success and the perceived importance of personal participation. Private social and normative rewards and costs also are relevant—but to a lesser extent—for the individual’s calculation of the expected utility of participation.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

To answer these questions, we conducted two online experiments in Turkey comparing the effects of two pro-democratic educational interventions, a positive frame emphasizing gains from democratic institutions and a negative frame highlighting the losses under authoritarian regimes. Both treatment frames were successful at building democratic demand. However, only participants exposed to the pro-democracy messages with a positive frame took important additional cognitive steps, decreasing their evaluations of Turkey’s democratic supply and, therefore, becoming less likely to vote for the parties aligned with the autocratic regime. We offer a reference points theory to explain this divergence. Overall, our research makes significant contributions to the literature on democracy promotion and democratic support among ordinary citizens.\n\n\nBUTTON LINKS\nDownload PDF"

The analysis distinguishes between direct and indirect causal mechanisms and employs a variety of statistical models that allow the authors to control for the unique democratization trend in each country when assessing causal effects, as well as for the potential endogeneity of U.S. democracy assistance.

I first develop hypotheses about the effects of civic education on participation from theories of political culture and recent work on recruitment and group mobilization. Using survey data collected on participants in numerous civic education programs as well as control groups in both countries, I then show that civic education has significant and substantively meaningful effects on local–level political participation in four of the seven programs studied in South Africa and the Dominican Republic and that the results hold after controlling for potential biases related to the individual’s self–selection into the programs. The effects of civic education on participation are largely conditional in nature, dependent on the frequency and nature of the civic education “treatment,” and the individual’s store of prior political and participatory resources. The results suggest that civic education and other group mobilization processes are highly complementary in both countries; civic education training stimulates individual political behavior in much the same way as does participation in other kinds of secondary group activities.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

Civic education first affected the knowledge, values, and participatory inclinations of individuals directly exposed to the Kenyan National Civic Education Programme (NCEP). These individuals became opinion leaders, communicating these new orientations to others within their social networks. Individuals who discussed others’ civic education experiences then showed significant growth in democratic knowledge and values, in many instances more than individuals with direct exposure to the program. We find further evidence of a “compensation effect,” such that the impact of civic education and post-civic education discussion was greater among Kenyans with less education and with lower levels of social integration.\n\nView at Journal Website"

In large groups, each individual reasons first that his or her participation will have little marginal impact on the likelihood that collective action would be successful. Further, individuals who do not participate cannot normally be denied the benefits of the “public goods”, e.g. a change in regime or public policy, which successful collective action can provide. As a result, rational individuals will prefer to abstain or “free-ride” on the efforts of others, reasoning that abstention will bring the same expected benefits as participation without any of the potentially severe personal, legal and opportunity costs involved in protest behavior.\n\nView at Journal Website"

Our findings suggest that online civic education has a considerable effect on democratic citizenship, including a significant reduction in authoritarian nostalgia and increasing intended political behavior.

We document the pattern using original data from two surveys on support for violent extremism conducted in three different countries in the Sahel region of Africa. We rule out a host of alternative explanations and further confirm that the pattern can arise not just with overt survey measures but even with covert, experimental ones.

However, there has been a lack of empirical research directly demonstrating the links between elites and the masses whose thinking they supposedly cue and structure. This paper attempts to show, through magnitude scale data collected over time in the 1980 campaign, the significant impact of political candidates in altering ideological perceptions of political stimuli. The chief “carrier” of ideology in 1980 is shown to be Ronald Reagan, whose strong issue stands and ideological label influenced perceptions of specific issues’ ideological content. The findings are discussed in terms of both measurement problems in the ideology literature and more general theories of elite and environmental influences on mass political thought.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

Ethnic minority Tamil—and to a lesser degree, Muslim—turnout was depressed by a variety of factors in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, where support for Wickremesinghe and the UNP was especially strong.

The results show that at the aggregate level, the public changed very little in its ideological evaluations during these elections. At the individual level, though, changes were correlated to some extent with interest in the campaign and with educational attainment. The political environment appears to have a discernible, though limited, role in structuring mass ideological evaluations over time.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

Our analysis draws on nearly four million tweets directed at 1,834 candidates across the 2023 parliamentary and 2024 local election campaigns in Türkiye, providing a rare opportunity to observe how these dynamics unfold at both the national and subnational levels. We find that while online visibility increases abuse for all candidates, the effect is markedly stronger for women. Moreover, women are disproportionately targeted across diverse types of violence,including ridicule, sexualized insults, physical threats, and religious or ethnic hate speech.\n\nDownload PDF"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract:\n\nThe widespread adoption of interactive technologies and social media platforms has transformed the political landscape, initially promising to democratize public discourse and enhance participation among marginalized groups, including women. However, rather than equalizing opportunities, these platforms have increasingly become sites of online violence, disproportionately targeting women politicians. In this study, we argue that the digital abuse faced by female political candidates is not merely a reflection of their gender alone but a product of the intersection between gender, race, and partisan identity. Specifically, women of color affiliated with the Democratic Party are particularly vulnerable to online violence due to their symbolic representation of progressive change, while Republican white women also face heightened hostility linked to their association with traditional gender norms. To test this argument, we analyze over 800,000 social media posts targeting candidates in the 2024 U.S. Congressional elections, using a large language model to detect and categorize offensive and hate speech. Our findings reveal that Democratic women of color experience significantly higher rates of online political violence compared to their white or Republican counterparts. These results underscore the need for an intersectional approach to understanding digital political violence, highlighting how the combination of gender, race, and party affiliation shapes the unique vulnerabilities of women in politics.\n\nDownload PDF"

However, multivariate analyses indicate that marital status per se only modestly affects some dimensions of political orientation, including presidential vote. When various factors are controlled, the married have somewhat higher turnout rates than singles, but the latter are more inclined to political participation beyond the act of voting. The modest political effects of marital status do not appreciably differ by sex, age, or homeownership status.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

Early evaluation work reported generally positive effects, though recent work has been more skeptical, with some studies reporting negative impacts of civic education on political engagement through highlighting the poor performance of incumbents and ongoing political processes. In this article, we report the results of a field experiment using an encouragement design to assess the Voter Opinion and Involvement through Civic Education (VOICE) programme conducted in 2010-2011 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We adapt Bratton and Mattes’ (2007) “supply and demand” model of democratic support to the case of civic education, and derive hypotheses regarding expected impacts of VOICE on a series of democratic orientations and political participation. The results show that the VOICE programme had negative effects on support for the decentralization process and on individuals’ satisfaction with democracy in the DRC, and positive effects on non-electoral participation as well as on democratic orientations such as knowledge, efficacy, and political tolerance. We suggest that this pattern of effects has positive normative implications, and that civic education programmes continue to have the potential to deepen democratic engagement and values, even in fragile or backsliding democratic settings.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

Can polarized individuals be persuaded to choose democracy over party, that is, support a candidate from an opposing party who upholds democratic norms when their co-partisan candidate fails to do so? We tested the effect of an online civic education intervention conducted on over 41,000 individuals in thirty-three countries that was designed to promote the choice of ‘democracy’ by emphasizing the benefits of democratic versus autocratic regimes. The results are striking: exposure to civic education messages significantly dampens the negative effect of partisan polarization on anti-democratic co-partisan candidate choice. Civic education also has a small positive effect on polarization itself, with further exploration showing that this is the result of increased evaluations of parties that uphold democratic norms and practices, resulting in greater differences between democratic and anti-democratic parties.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

We develop a measure for the logit model based on a Taylor series polynomial expansion that solves the problems inherent in the nonlinearity and nonadditivity of the logit specification. The method can be used to make out-of-sample predictions based on real or hypothetical changes in one or more independent variables and may also be used to assess the relative “importance” of different independent variables by computing the change in dependent probabilities accounted for by each variable. The measure is in the same spirit as Achen’s (1982) “level importance” measure for linear models and thus fills an important gap in logit regression analysis. We show, on the basis of simulations and controlled validation in an empirical example, that the aggregate logit impact measure can produce numerical results that differ substantially from the equivalent measure for linear probability models. We provide guidance for future research on the detailed application of the logit method and the criteria for choice of the logit versus the linear aggregate impact measures.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Published by American Journal of Political Science.\nAbstract:\n\nTheory: Recent research contends that campaign “attack” advertising demobilizes the electorate, with particularly strong effects among political Independents. We dispute this claim, arguing instead that there is little reason to expect a powerful relationship between the tone of campaign advertising and voter turnout. Attack advertising may depress turnout among some voters, but it is likely to stimulate others by increasing their store of political information about the candidates, by increasing the degree to which they care about the election’s outcome, or by increasing ties to their party’s nominee. Hypothesis: The amount of a campaign’s attack political advertising will be unrelated to overall voter turnout and to turnout among Independents. Methods: We employ a multi-method research design, combining a systematic content analysis of presidential campaign advertisements from 1960 to 1992 with aggregate data on turnout and the pooled National Election Studies survey data set. Correlational, linear, and logistic regression analyses are performed. Results: Controlling for other variables known to influence turnout, we find that attack advertising does not influence either overall turnout rates or individual self-reported votes. Similarly, we find no demobilizing effect for negative advertisements among Independent voters. Further survey analyses show that the effect of attack advertisements on voter withdrawal is weakest among individuals who are most highly attentive to the mass media, and thus who are most likely to have read about or seen the negativity of the campaign.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

We argue that in communities with high levels of reported violence, individuals lose political and social trust, develop exclusionary attitudes towards outgroups, and find appeal in nonconventional, black-or-white religious teachings, all of which can promote support for extremist violence. Using survey data from over 17,000 respondents in 84 communes surveyed between 2013 and 2017 in Burkina Faso, Niger, and Chad, we find strong support for these predictions. More violent communities express substantially greater support for violent extremism, with an increase in exclusionary outgroup biases and a turn to fundamentalist religious views being the primary mechanisms explaining—and amplifying—the effect. The findings run counter to arguments suggesting that exposure to violence leads to “war weariness” or generates community resilience to extremism via prosocial behaviors.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

Using data from nearly 4,000 respondents in thirty-five communes in Burkina Faso, Chad, and Niger collected just prior to a recent wave of terrorist attacks, we find that communes where individuals under-report their true support for violent extremism—as measured with unobtrusive experimental methods—have a greater probability of experiencing subsequent Islamist attacks, controlling for socio-demographic characteristics of the commune, country-level proximity effects, and other time-varying factors. The findings raise important considerations regarding the measurement of extremist support, and they suggest a new tool for identifying communities potentially susceptible to terrorist violence.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

We find that the dominant effects of the campaign on German voters, as in the Lazarsfeld et al. studies from the 1940s and in more recent US research, were the ‘reinforcement’ of earlier preferences and the ‘activation’ of latent vote dispositions based on fundamental individual attitudes such as party affiliation and left–right ideology. At the same time, the analysis shows that the number of campaign ‘converts’ (those who vote against their dispositions and prior preferences) was approximately 14 per cent of the electorate. The vote division among these individuals was overwhelmingly pro-government, suggesting that the 1990 German campaign altered a sufficient number of votes to turn what was an even contest, based on the electorate’s initial political dispositions, into a solid government coalition victory.\n\nView at Journal Website"

We extend these analyses by examining the effects of party identification and strength of identification on participation in both campaign activities and political protest. We hypothesize that party differences in these behaviors can be explained by the different levels of participatory incentives perceived by party identifiers and nonidentifiers. We specify a series of incentives derived from theories of collective action and measure them in a national and a community probability sample in the Federal Republic of Germany. The results show that the bivariate relationships between party identification and political participation can be explained largely through their mutual relationship with participatory incentives such as policy dissatisfaction, belief in the moral justifiability of various forms of behavior, and willingness to conform to the behavioral expectations of important others. The effects of identification with all parties on participation are substantially reduced once the effects of the incentives are taken into account, and for protest participation, only identification with the Greens shows a nonnegligible net impact.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

In this paper, we explain the “anomaly” of the 1980 election in which strong liberals participated at higher rates despite a very strong conservative on the Republican side. Using data collected over time in 1980 by the University of Michigan’s Center for Political Studies (CPS/NES), we broaden the Beck-Jennings model to include participation during the primary season and hypothesize that mobilization of ideological groups may result from ideological candidates and the competitiveness or closeness of a nomination contest. We find that the ideological candidate model explains general election participation to a significant degree, while competitiveness considerations are more important for mobilization during the primaries.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

Using panel data collected on a national sample in West Germany between 1987 and 1989, we show that variables from a “collective interest” model measured in 1987—individuals’ dissatisfaction with the provision of collective goods, beliefs that group actions can be successful, and beliefs in the importance of their own participation—predict subsequent participation in collective protest activities. Variables corresponding to the private “selective incentives” associated with protest are found to be less relevant. Furthermore, we find that engaging in protest changes many of the perceptions that influence future participation.

After more than a decade of civic education evaluations, it is a good time to take stock of what we have learned about the impacts of these efforts to strengthen democratic political culture in developing democracies. This article describes four US Agency for International Development-sponsored evaluations that have been conducted since the late 1990s, summarizes their most important findings, and discusses the lessons learned. I show that civic education can have meaningful and relatively long-lasting effects in terms of increasing political information, increasing feelings of empowerment, and mobilizing individuals, even in contexts beset by political and ethnic violence. However, these interventions are much less likely to affect ‘deep-seated’ democratic values such as political tolerance, support, and trust. Moreover, the size of the effects depends critically on how the programmes are designed, the kinds of pedagogical methods employed, and the quality of the trainers. I conclude with a discussion of current developments in the field.\n\nView at Journal Website"

    "text": "Published by American Journal of Political Science.\nAbstract:\n\nWhile there have been numerous empirical studies of the causal determinants of voting behavior and other acts of political participation, political scientists have virtually ignored the consequences of such activity for the individual. Recent democratic theory asserts that participation should have significant individual-level effects, a hypothesis which is empirically tested in this paper. The effects of electoral and campaign participation on political efficacy are estimated in the context of a nonrecursive longitudinal model using the SRC 1972-1974-1976 panel study. It is found that these forms of participation exert positive impact mainly on the “external” or system responsiveness dimension of efficacy, and that these effects hold after controlling for educational attainment. These findings illustrate that engaging in political action does influence certain political attitudes, a fact which should be taken into account through reciprocal effects models of political attitude and behavior. The specific effect of participation on “external” efficacy also has important system-level consequences, as electoral and campaign acts influence the distribution of support for the regime or regime norms.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

    "text": "Published by Journal of Democracy.\nAbstract:\n\nUsing a newly constructed dataset of all U.S. expenditures in foreign assistance channeled via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) from 1990 through 2005, this essay traces the growth of global democracy assistance since the end of the Cold War. It shows that what had begun as a largely regional effort in Latin America in the late 1980s has grown into a world-wide effort, expanding in magnitude and diversity, branching out into areas such as “good governance” (essentially decentralization and the fight against corruption) that were given little attention in the early 1990s.\n\nView at Journal Website"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Published by The Journal of Politics.\nAbstract:\n\nAlthough much recent work suggests that contemporary presidential campaigns have more powerful electoral effects than were seen in previous decades, there has been little research that examines the actual effect of recent campaigns on individual vote choice. Using the 1980 NES panel study, I show that the overwhelming majority of individual votes can be accounted for from attitudes such as party identification and presidential approval that are measured before the political conventions, and that changes in orientations during the campaign had limited effects on individual vote choice and negligible consequences for the electoral outcome. Moreover, models derived from the 1980 panel data can predict with a great deal of accuracy the aggregate outcomes of the 1984 and 1988 presidential contests. I argue that the results support an “activation” model of campaign effects in recent elections: rather than simply reinforcing individuals’ preexisting vote intentions, the campaigns served mainly to activate existing political predispositions and make them electorally relevant. At the same time, the results show that campaigns have the potential to exert larger electoral effects, but in recent elections they have not done so.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

    "text": "Published by Political Psychology.\nAbstract:\n\nDespite the proliferation of civic education programs in the emerging democracies of Latin America, Africa, and Eastern Europe, there have been few recent evaluations of the effectiveness of civics instruction in achieving changes in democratic orientations among student populations. We present findings from a study conducted in 1998 that examined the impact of democratic civic education among South African high school students. Using a battery of items to gauge democratic orientations, including measures of political knowledge, civic duty, tolerance, institutional trust, civic skills, and approval of legal forms of political participation, we find that civic education had the largest effects on political knowledge, with the magnitude of the effect being approximately twice as large as the recent Niemi and Junn (1998) finding for the United States. Exposure to civic education per se had weaker effects on democratic values and skills; for these orientations, what matters are specific factors related to the quality of instruction and the use of active pedagogical methods employed by civics instructors. Further, we find that civic education changed the structure of students’ orientations: a “democratic values” dimension coalesces more strongly, and in greater distinction, from a “political competence” dimension among students exposed to civic education than among those with no such training. We discuss the implications of the findings for our theoretical understanding of the role of civic education in fostering democratic attitudes, norms, and values, as well as the practical implications of the results for the implementation and funding of civic education programs in developing democracies in the future.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

It presents evidence showing the extent to which these two measurements of partisanship do and do not coincide, and the reasons for the relationship. The evidence points strongly to the conclusion that party enrollment systems affect the way some voters perceive the nature of partisanship, or at least the way they respond to the party identification question, with the result that survey responses may fail to present an accurate picture of voter feelings of party allegiance or of political independence.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"

    "text": "Published by Journal of Democracy.\nAbstract:\n\nThis paper examines the effects of adult civic education programs on political participation, civic competence, and support for democratic values in three developing democracies, the Dominican Republic, Poland and South Africa. I show that participation in civic education programs conducted by NGOs in each country had meaningful impact on local-level political participation in all three countries, and modest impact on individuals’ knowledge, efficacy and support for values such as political tolerance. The effects of the programs were sharply increased when individuals were trained more frequently and with more active, participatory teaching methods. The results have important implications regarding the extent to which democratic political orientations can be “engineered” through civics training conducted by civil society groups, as well as important policy implications regarding how such programs should best be structured and implemented in practice.\n\nDownload PDF View at Journal Website"
